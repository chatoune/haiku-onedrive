# Project Development Rules - Haiku OneDrive Client

## ðŸ”’ MANDATORY RULES FOR ALL DEVELOPMENT SESSIONS

### Rule 1: Documentation After Every Step (CRITICAL)
**Every single code change, decision, or action MUST be documented immediately.**

1. **SESSION_LOG.md**: Update after EVERY action with:
   - Timestamp
   - Action taken
   - Files modified/created
   - Decisions made and rationale
   - Problems encountered
   - Solutions implemented
   - Next steps identified

2. **Project State Persistence**: After each step, update:
   - `.claude/project_state.json` - Machine-readable current state
   - `PROGRESS.md` - Human-readable progress tracking
   - Component-specific documentation in relevant directories

3. **Code Documentation**: 
   - EVERY file must have a header comment explaining its purpose
   - EVERY function must have documentation
   - EVERY significant code block must have explanatory comments
   - Use Doxygen format for all documentation

### Rule 2: State Management Between Sessions
**Project must be resumable by any developer (including AI) at any time.**

1. **Before Ending Any Work Session**:
   - Run `git add -A && git commit -m "WIP: [description]"`
   - Update SESSION_LOG.md with session summary
   - Update .claude/project_state.json with current state
   - Document any blocking issues or dependencies

2. **When Starting Any Work Session**:
   - Read SESSION_LOG.md to understand previous work
   - Check .claude/project_state.json for current state
   - Review any TODO items or blocking issues
   - Continue from exact stopping point

### Rule 3: Incremental Development Approach
**Build small, test often, document always.**

1. **Development Cycle**:
   - Plan step (document in SESSION_LOG.md)
   - Implement step (small, focused changes)
   - Test step (verify it works)
   - Document step (update all tracking files)
   - Commit step (git commit with descriptive message)

2. **Never Skip Documentation**:
   - Even for "trivial" changes
   - Even for "temporary" code
   - Even for "obvious" decisions

### Rule 4: File Organization Standards
**Consistent structure for predictable navigation.**

```
/Storage/Development/OneDrive/
â”œâ”€â”€ PROJECT_RULES.md          # This file - development rules
â”œâ”€â”€ SESSION_LOG.md           # Detailed session-by-session log
â”œâ”€â”€ PROGRESS.md              # High-level progress tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ ARCHITECTURE.md          # System architecture decisions
â”œâ”€â”€ .claude/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project_state.json  # Current state for AI continuation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dependencies.json   # External dependencies tracking
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ blockers.json      # Current blocking issues
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                   # User-facing documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                    # Source code
â””â”€â”€ tests/                  # Test files
```

### Rule 5: Git Commit Standards
**Every commit must be meaningful and traceable.**

1. **Commit Message Format**:
   ```
   [Component] Action: Brief description
   
   - Detailed change 1
   - Detailed change 2
   
   Session: [Session ID]
   State: [WIP|STABLE|TESTED]
   Next: [What needs to be done next]
   ```

2. **Commit Frequency**:
   - After each completed step
   - Before any major changes
   - At least every 30 minutes during active development
   - ALWAYS before ending a session

### Rule 6: Testing and Validation
**No code without verification.**

1. **Before Moving to Next Step**:
   - Verify current code compiles (if applicable)
   - Run any existing tests
   - Document test results in SESSION_LOG.md
   - Fix any issues before proceeding

2. **Test Documentation**:
   - Document what was tested
   - Document how it was tested
   - Document test results
   - Document any issues found

### Rule 7: Dependency Tracking
**Every external dependency must be documented.**

1. **When Adding Dependencies**:
   - Document in .claude/dependencies.json
   - Include version requirements
   - Include installation instructions
   - Include fallback options

### Rule 8: Error Handling and Recovery
**Plan for failure, document for success.**

1. **When Errors Occur**:
   - Document exact error message
   - Document steps that led to error
   - Document attempted solutions
   - Document final resolution
   - Update blockers.json if unresolved

### Rule 9: Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
**Every significant decision must be recorded.**

1. **Create ADR for**:
   - Technology choices
   - Design patterns
   - API designs
   - File structures
   - Algorithm selections

2. **ADR Format**:
   ```markdown
   # ADR-[number]: [Title]
   
   ## Status
   [Proposed|Accepted|Deprecated|Superseded]
   
   ## Context
   What is the issue we're addressing?
   
   ## Decision
   What have we decided to do?
   
   ## Consequences
   What are the implications?
   
   ## Alternatives Considered
   What other options were evaluated?
   ```

### Rule 10: Continuous Integration Mindset
**Always leave the project in a better state than you found it.**

1. **Before Starting Work**:
   - Ensure project builds
   - Review recent changes
   - Understand current state

2. **After Completing Work**:
   - Ensure project still builds
   - Update all documentation
   - Leave clear next steps

### Rule 11: Haiku-Native Development (MANDATORY)
**This project MUST be a true Haiku OS native application using Haiku APIs wherever possible.**

1. **API Usage Priority**:
   - **ALWAYS** use Haiku native APIs before considering external libraries
   - **PREFER** BeAPI/Haiku Kit classes over POSIX/standard C++
   - **SEARCH** Haiku headers before implementing custom functionality
   - **INTEGRATE** with Haiku system services and patterns

2. **Native Components to Use**:
   - **UI**: Use native BWindow, BView, BControl classes
   - **Threading**: Use BLooper, BHandler, BMessage system
   - **Networking**: Use BNetworkKit, BHttpRequest
   - **Storage**: Use BFile, BDirectory, BPath, BEntry
   - **Settings**: Use BMessage for preferences, Haiku settings directory
   - **IPC**: Use BMessage and scripting protocol
   - **Graphics**: Use native drawing APIs, HVIF for icons

3. **Development Guidelines**:
   - Follow Haiku coding style guidelines
   - Use Haiku-specific build tools when appropriate
   - Integrate with Tracker, Deskbar, and other system components
   - Respect Haiku's unified preferences and theming
   - Use native file attributes and queries

4. **External Libraries**:
   - Only use when NO Haiku alternative exists
   - Document why Haiku API was insufficient
   - Prefer libraries already in HaikuPorts
   - Minimize external dependencies

5. **Testing Native Integration**:
   - Test with different Haiku themes
   - Verify Tracker add-on functionality
   - Check replicant support where applicable
   - Ensure proper system shutdown behavior
   - Validate attribute preservation

### Rule 12: No Code Without Explicit Request (CRITICAL)
**NO code implementation until specifically requested by the user.**

1. **Planning Phase Requirements**:
   - **DOCUMENTATION FIRST**: All planning, architecture, and design must be completed
   - **NO IMPLEMENTATION**: Do not write any source code files (.cpp, .h, etc.)
   - **DESIGN ONLY**: Focus on specifications, diagrams, and documentation
   - **WAIT FOR REQUEST**: Only begin coding when user explicitly says to start

2. **What IS Allowed Before Coding**:
   - Architecture documentation and diagrams
   - API design and specifications
   - File structure planning
   - Dependency analysis
   - Risk assessment
   - Development timeline planning
   - Technology research

3. **What is NOT Allowed**:
   - Creating source files (.cpp, .h)
   - Writing implementation code
   - Creating build files (CMakeLists.txt, Makefile)
   - Setting up project scaffolding
   - Any executable code

4. **User Request Triggers**:
   - "Start coding"
   - "Implement [component]"
   - "Create the source files"
   - "Begin development"
   - Any explicit request to write code

5. **Rationale**:
   - Ensures thorough planning before implementation
   - Prevents premature code that may need refactoring
   - Allows user to review and approve all designs
   - Maintains clear separation between planning and implementation phases

## ðŸš¨ ENFORCEMENT

**These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Any session that doesn't follow these rules should be considered incomplete and potentially harmful to project continuity.**

- [ ] Git commit created?
- [ ] Tests passing (if any)?
- [ ] Next steps documented?

### Session Handoff Checklist:
- [ ] All changes committed?
