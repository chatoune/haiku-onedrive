**Duration**: 13:19 - ongoing

#### Actions Taken:
1. [13:19] - Created fresh-start branch and cleaned workspace
   - Files affected: All files deleted except .git
   - Outcome: Clean workspace achieved
   - Issues: None

2. [13:20] - Created PROJECT_RULES.md
   - Files affected: PROJECT_RULES.md (new)
   - Outcome: Comprehensive development rules established
   - Issues: None
   - Content: 
     * Rule 1: Documentation after every step
     * Rule 2: State management between sessions
     * Rule 3: Incremental development approach
     * Rule 4: File organization standards
     * Rule 5: Git commit standards
     * Rule 6: Testing and validation
     * Rule 7: Dependency tracking
     * Rule 8: Error handling and recovery
     * Rule 9: Architecture Decision Records
     * Rule 10: Continuous integration mindset

3. [13:21] - Created SESSION_LOG.md (this file)
   - Files affected: SESSION_LOG.md (new)
   - Outcome: Session tracking system established
   - Issues: None

4. [13:22] - Created .claude directory and project_state.json
   - Files affected: .claude/project_state.json (new)
   - Outcome: Machine-readable state tracking established
   - Issues: None
   - Content: Comprehensive project state including current phase, tasks, dependencies, and git status

5. [13:23] - Created PROGRESS.md
   - Files affected: PROGRESS.md (new)
   - Outcome: High-level progress tracking system established
   - Issues: None
   - Content: Milestone-based progress tracking with 6 major milestones defined

6. [13:24] - Created ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Files affected: ARCHITECTURE.md (new)
   - Outcome: Architecture decision documentation system established
   - Issues: None
   - Content: ADR template, system architecture diagram, component responsibilities

#### Decisions Made:
- **Fresh Start Approach**: Decided to start from scratch rather than continue previous implementation to ensure clean architecture and proper documentation from the beginning
- **Documentation-First Development**: Every action must be documented before moving to the next step
- **State Persistence**: All project state must be stored in multiple formats (human-readable and machine-readable)
- **Architecture Decision Records**: All technical decisions will be documented in ARCHITECTURE.md using ADR format
- **Component Architecture**: Modular design with daemon, auth manager, sync engine, cache manager, API client, preferences app, and tracker add-on

#### Next Actions Planned:
- Commit all foundation files to git
- Create initial project structure directories
- Choose build system (CMake vs Jam)
- Set up development environment

7. [13:26] - Committed foundation files
   - Files affected: All documentation files
   - Outcome: Clean git history with foundation commit
   - Issues: None
   - Commit: 311def0

8. [13:28] - Added Rule 11: Haiku-Native Development to PROJECT_RULES.md
   - Files affected: PROJECT_RULES.md (modified)
   - Outcome: Established mandatory native API usage
   - Issues: None
   - Content: Detailed requirements for using Haiku APIs, native components list, development guidelines

9. [13:29] - Updated ARCHITECTURE.md with native development decisions
   - Files affected: ARCHITECTURE.md (modified)
   - Outcome: ADR-002 and ADR-003 accepted
   - Issues: None
   - Decisions:
     * ADR-002: Haiku-Native Development Approach (use native APIs exclusively)
     * ADR-003: Technology Stack (C++, CMake, Native UI Kit, BLooper/BHandler, BNetworkKit)

10. [13:29] - Updated project_state.json with architecture decisions
    - Files affected: .claude/project_state.json (modified)
