#### Decisions Made:
- **Fresh Start Approach**: Decided to start from scratch rather than continue previous implementation to ensure clean architecture and proper documentation from the beginning
- **Documentation-First Development**: Every action must be documented before moving to the next step
- **State Persistence**: All project state must be stored in multiple formats (human-readable and machine-readable)
- **Architecture Decision Records**: All technical decisions will be documented in ARCHITECTURE.md using ADR format
- **Component Architecture**: Modular design with daemon, auth manager, sync engine, cache manager, API client, preferences app, and tracker add-on

#### Next Actions Planned:
- Commit all foundation files to git
- Create initial project structure directories
- Choose build system (CMake vs Jam)
- Set up development environment

#### Session Summary:
- Completed: Complete documentation infrastructure (PROJECT_RULES.md, SESSION_LOG.md, project_state.json, PROGRESS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Blocked: None
- Next Steps: Commit foundation and begin technical setup
