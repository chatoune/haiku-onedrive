# Haiku OneDrive Client

A native OneDrive client for Haiku OS that provides seamless filesystem integration with Microsoft OneDrive cloud storage.

## Features

- **Native Haiku Integration**: Built specifically for Haiku OS using native APIs and UI components
- **BFS Attribute Sync**: Full support for Haiku's extended file attributes with bidirectional synchronization
- **Real-time File Sync**: Automatic synchronization of files and folders with OneDrive
- **Virtual Filesystem**: Support for online-only files with on-demand downloading
- **Custom Icon Overlays**: Visual sync status indicators in Tracker
- **OAuth2 Authentication**: Secure authentication with Microsoft accounts
- **Conflict Resolution**: Smart conflict detection and resolution strategies
- **Bandwidth Management**: Configurable upload/download limits
- **Offline Support**: Work offline with automatic sync when connection returns

## Architecture

The project consists of several components:

- **OneDrive Daemon**: Background service handling all synchronization operations
- **Preferences Application**: Native Haiku GUI for configuration and account management
- **API Library**: Microsoft Graph API client for OneDrive operations
- **Attribute Manager**: BFS extended attribute synchronization system
- **Virtual Filesystem**: File state tracking and on-demand download system

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Haiku R1/beta4 or later
- CMake 3.16+
- Doxygen (for documentation generation)
- Git

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/haiku-onedrive.git
cd haiku-onedrive

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build the project
make -j4

# Generate documentation (optional)
make docs

# Install (optional)
